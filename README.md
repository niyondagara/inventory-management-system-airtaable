# inventory-management-system-airtable
## Project description**
This project is a small inventory management system I built in Airtable. Itâ€™s a relational database with tables for Products, Suppliers, Sales, and Customers. designed to reflect the real workflow of inventory management.
The system highlights how products are received, stored, and tracked through sales records

It also integrates: â€¢>> Automation to monitor and track inventory units (quantities)
>>â€¢ A user-friendly input form for adding specific information quickly and accurately
